This is a friend finder app, designed to allow a user to fillout a survey and compare them to a list of friends and show them the closest match. I am having trouble with this app, the last function to compare the current user to the list of friends is not working.  I can't get it to show the modal with the result or get the results. Still working on it. I also had trouble deploying to heroku because I forgot to add process.env.PORT to the port variable.
