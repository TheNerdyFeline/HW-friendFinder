This is a friend finder app, designed to allow a user to fillout a survey and compare them to a list of friends and show them the closest match. I am having trouble with this app, the last function to compare the current user to the list of friends is not working.  I can't get it to show the modal; with the result or get the results. Still working on it. I am also having trouble deploying to heroku because there directions suck.
